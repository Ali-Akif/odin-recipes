# Odin Recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. It is a simple website that lists recipes. The purpose of this project is to practice basic HTML and project structure skills.
I've used [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) to learn Flexbox.

## Description
